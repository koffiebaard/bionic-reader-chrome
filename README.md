## Font

It overrides the font of the webpage as many (many) fonts don't work with Bionic Reading. This is mainly because of the size of bold and thin letters, and it seems having mono-spaced sans fonts improves neurodiverse reading capabilities anyway.

It currently uses Google's Open Sans, which I want to make configurable once I have the time.
