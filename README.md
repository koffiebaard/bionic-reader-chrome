## Font
It overrides the font of the webpage as many (many) fonts don't work with Bionic Reading. This is mainly because of the size of bold and thin letters, and it seems having mono-spaced sans fonts improves neurodiverse reading capabilities anyway.

It currently uses Google's Open Sans, which I want to make configurable once I have the time.

## How to install
As it's not in the webstore yet, you can add it with these steps:

- Download the repo (git clone, or as a zip and unpack)
- Go to `Settings`, and then `Extensions`
- Enable `Developer mode` on the right top side
- Press the `Load unpackaged` button on the left top side
- Select the directory with the repository
